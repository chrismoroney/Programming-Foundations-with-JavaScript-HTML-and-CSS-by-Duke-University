  <h3> Actions of a defender </h3>
  <p> All players playing defense will do some form of these following actions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Blitz </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Rushing to towards the offensive backfield where the Quarterback and Running-backs are</li>
    </ul>
    <li> Contain </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Preventing the Quarterback in the backfield from being able to escape the pocket area he takes the snap from </li>
    </ul>
    <li> Draw </li>
    <ul>
      <li>To take up blockers onto yourself to allow other defenders to sieze a gap or rush the Quarterback </li>
    </ul>
    <li> Play man-on-man coverage </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Lining up directly or indirectly against a reciever of any kind on the offense and sticking onto that man when the Quarterback scans to throw the ball</li>
    </ul>
    <li> Play zone coverage </li>
    <ul>
      <li> To play a designated area of the field on the pass attack </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p> Often times, coaches will assign these actions to each player on the field. The actions will also change often so that the defense may remain unpredictable to the offense.

      <h3> Which players to put on </h3>
      <p> Knowing which players to put on in certain situations will lead your team to be most prepared on defense. This in return will put your team in advantage to force turnovers and get the ball back for your offense to score. </p>
      <p> Defensive schemes are typically read from defensive linemen, to linebackers, to defensive backs. For example, in a 3-4 defense set, there are 3 down linemen, 4 linebackers, and doing the math, there are 4 defensive backs. The number of defensive
        backs can also be read with the words in a form of U.S.A currency from smaller to greater. For example, in the 4-2 Nickel formation, there 4 down linemen, 2 linebackers, and 5 defensive backs. This shows now that when the number of linemen or
        linebackers goes down, a defensive back comes onto the field. In a dime formation (a larger currency than the nickel), there are now 6 defensive backs on the field. Just think this: more money in set, more defensive backs.
    </body>
    <p> Here are some more basic defenses to put on the field: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="defensiveschemes"> 3-4 defense </li>
      <ul>
        <li> 3 defensive linemen </li>
        <li> 4 linebackers </li>
        <li> 4 defensive backs </li>
      </ul>
      <li class="defensiveschemes"> 4-3 defense </li>
      <ul>
        <li> 4 defensive linemen </li>
        <li> 3 linebackers </li>
        <li> 4 defensive backs </li>
      </ul>
      <li class="defensiveschemes"> 3-3 Nickel </li>
      <ul>
        <li> 3 defensive linemen </li>
        <li> 3 linebackers </li>
        <li class="defensivebackchanges"> 5 defensive backs </li>
      </ul>
      <li class="defensiveschemes"> 4-2 Nickel </li>
      <ul>
        <li> 4 defensive linemen </li>
        <li> 2 linebackers </li>
        <li class="defensivebackchanges"> 5 defensive backs </li>
      </ul>
      <li class="defensiveschemes"> 4-1 Dime </li>
      <ul>
        <li> 4 defensive linemen </li>
        <li> 1 linebacker </li>
        <li class="defensivebackchanges"> 6 defensive backs </li>
      </ul>
      <li class="defensiveschemes"> 3-1 Quarter </li>
      <ul>
        <li> 3 defensive linemen </li>
        <li> 1 linebacker </li>
        <li class="defensivebackchanges"> 7 defensive backs </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3> So what do these formations mean? </h3>
    <p> Ultimately, it is a guessing game to know what the offense is going to play given a certain scenario. Often times it can be easy to predict what the offense will do, but there are times when it is not so simple. Players on the field will often guess
      what the play is. Linemen can always assume they need to rush somehow, being in a gap or to the Quarterback. Linebackers and defensive backs need to read whether the play is a run, pass, play-actions, screen etc. </p>
    <p> However, the defensive coordinator needs to be one step ahead of the game. This is where the defensive formations come into play. If the offense is at <b> 3rd and 23 yards </b> to get to a first down, it is pretty easy to assume the Quarterback is
      going to <em>pass the ball</em>. This way, the defensive coordinator would put his nickel or dime package onto the field to try and <b> stop the pass </b> with <b> more defensive backs </b>. If the play is <b>2nd and 1 yard</b> to get to a 1st down,
      the play can be assumed mostly to be <em>a run</em>. This way, the coordinator can now put <b>more linemen or linebackers</b> to <b>cover the run</b>. </p>
     <p> American Football is a game about decieving and adapting to what is happening in the game. A big part of this lies withing the defense and their actions. The defense is the game changer in Football. One play, mistake, success, or even one tackle can interpret the rest of the game for either team. </p>
